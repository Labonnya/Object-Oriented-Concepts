Codes for OOC-2 course

The folder contains code examples and implementations of various object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. It includes the following topics:

1. Collections: The code in this section focuses on different collection classes and data structures available in OOP languages, demonstrating how to use them effectively for storing, manipulating, and organizing data. Examples may include lists, arrays, queues, stacks, dictionaries, and sets.

2. Generics: This section explores the concept of generics in OOP, showcasing how to write reusable code that can work with different types of data. It demonstrates how to create generic classes, methods, and interfaces, enabling the creation of flexible and type-safe code.

3. Threads: The code in this section delves into multithreading and concurrent programming. It demonstrates how to create and manage threads, synchronize access to shared resources, handle thread synchronization and communication, and showcase various threading concepts like thread pools, thread synchronization mechanisms, and thread-safe programming.

4. Socket Programming: This section focuses on network programming using sockets. It covers topics such as creating server-client applications, establishing network connections, sending and receiving data over TCP/IP or UDP protocols, handling network errors, and implementing client-server communication protocols.

Overall, this folder provides a comprehensive collection of code examples that showcase the practical implementation of important OOP concepts such as collections, generics, threads, and socket programming. It serves as a valuable resource for developers looking to understand and apply these concepts in their own projects.
